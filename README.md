## Development server

In order to build and run the project run the following:
 - `npm install`
 - `npm start`
 - Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` (The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.)

Alternativly you can click the `Code` > `Codespaces`, and create a Codespace. Node and all packages will be installed automatically. Once everything is installed in the Codespace take the following steps:
 - `npm start`
 - After build completes click `Open in Browser` button to view the live development build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
